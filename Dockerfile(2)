# This image will be based on the ubuntu image.  Build it using the
# command in the comment below.  You may omit the ubuntu pull if you already
# did it.  Before running the build, change into the directory containing
# this Dockerfile.  (Remember, the filename is "Dockerfile" with no
# extension.)
#
# docker pull ubuntu
# docker build --tag myubuntu  .
#
# (Don't forget the trailing . to specify that this directory is the context.)

# The timezone library stops the docker build and waits for user input to
# select a timezone. This pauses/breaks the build. To get around this,
# set up timezone environment variables prior to installing that library.
# This Docker code does that. Composited from two sources:
# https://rtfm.co.ua/en/docker-configure-tzdata-and-timezone-during-build/
# https://serverfault.com/questions/949991/how-to-install-tzdata-on-a-ubuntu-docker-image

# Install a handful of useful libraries.  Note that this is generally against
# best practices -- containers should be lean, and not include 'things you
# might use'.  In our case, we're using the containers for development, so
# this may be reasonable temporarily.
